  2017/03/31 2.79 released
  - For low-end PC (PC not so fast), the function which can automatically
    optimize the setting was added.
    * Even with Intel Atom(Z8350 for Tablet PC, Stick PC) CPU, Ootake operates
      pretty comfortably at window size up to x2 (full screen 800x600).
    Here is the optimization method.
    ==========================================================================
    Push "Setting" button on the start screen (bottom left on the screen) ->
    Push "Set CD-DA Play Timing" button (top button) -> OK button ->
    Push "High Quality PSG (Defalt)" button (top button).
    Optimization is completed in 60 seconds if your PC has enough speed.
    In the case of a low-end PC, the fact that power is insufficient is
    displayed and the setting is automatically lowered. Then, press the OK
    button and wait 60 seconds again to complete the optimization.
    ==========================================================================
  - When Intel built-in graphics is used, it starts with the setting which is
    lighter(Light PSG. fast) than the default setting.
  - Add "Message Time 100% - 20%" to the setting menu(above the game screen).
    It is possible to adjust the display time of system messages.
  - Supports V-Sync at refresh rate "120 Hz" display output.
    * For 120Hz compatible display for gamers.
  - Add "Full Screen 120Hz" to the Screen menu. When this is selected, it can
    be displayed at 120Hz with full-screen mode.
    * With the Window mode, if the desktop display is 120Hz, V-Sync will be
      performed automatically at 120Hz even if this is not selected.
  - The operation of the PCE built-in sound (wave memory sound) has been
    brought close to the real machine. In "Cyber Night" and
    "Fire Pro-Wrestling" series, the problem of sound has been resolved.
  - Improved Joypad initialization function. If the controller is not
    functioning correctly, please initialize the pad settings once by clicking
    "Input -> Initialize Pad # 1 - # 5 (fourth from bottom)" menu.
  - Fixed a bug that shortcut keys such as Screenshot did not work when
    reproducing the game play with "Capture -> Play Record (F6 key)" menu.
  - Additionally, a detailed part has been improved and corrected.

  * The happiness of the game is the world human race commonness. It longs for
    peace.
  * I think that it cannot do improvement & correction of the above-mentioned
    if there are many neither operation report nor defect report. Thank you
    really for you who reported.
