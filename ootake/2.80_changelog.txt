  2017/04/16 2.80 released
  - The operation part of the joypad is brought close to the operation of the
    actual machine. In "Magicoal", the problem that two people play could not
    be played was solved.
  - The timing of the operation is brought close to the operation of the
    actual machine. In "The Legendary Axe II", the problem that the screen was
    dark one frame at the start demo was solved.
  - "HES BigAudioBuffer (Frame Skip)" was added to the Audio menu. When this
    is checked, if the HES file (program for PCE's built-in sound, extension
    is ".hes") is opened, it is started with BigAudioBuffer mode(sound is
    delayed but stable processing with a large buffer and omitting the
    drawing).
  - Additionally, a detailed part has been improved and corrected.

  * The happiness of the game is the world human race commonness. It longs for
    peace.
  * I think that it cannot do improvement & correction of the above-mentioned
    if there are many neither operation report nor defect report. Thank you
    really for you who reported.
