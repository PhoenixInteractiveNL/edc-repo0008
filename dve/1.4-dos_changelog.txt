1.4  - 3d Imager support!
       Finally I had some time to look at it. It sort of works, it is not
       perfect yet, but...
       First some drawbacks...
       I have no 3d imager, neither have I seen one working yet, I
       don't really know what the games look like, so if
       I have some color settings wrong, feel free to do better...
       Right now I'm emulating a fixed speed for the spinning wheel.
       Vectrex usually wants to fiddle with that speed, that is not suported
       yet (dunno if it ever will be...).
       "Narrow Escape" and "Crazy Coaster" work just about fine.
       "Mine 3d" so so, I suspect it to change the rate of the
       color wheel during the startup screen, since I can't find a
       speed setting that will satisfy both the game and the startup...

       There are some new settings for the *.vol files, as e.g.:
       
       3D_IMAGER_GAME
       WHEEL_TICKS #number#
       COLOR_1_DEGREES #number#
       COLOR_2_DEGREES #number#
       COLOR_3_DEGREES #number#
       IMAGER_MODE #number#

       Most of these are fairly selfexplanatory, but here is what they
       do anyhow.

       3D_IMAGER_GAME - tells the emulator, that the game for this
       *.vol file is a GOGGLE-GAME.

       WHEEL_TICKS #number# - you tell the *.vol file the speed with which
       the wheel has to spin. One tick is 1/1500000 second.
       (vectrex 6809 runs at 1.5Mhz) Good values to start with are
       between 40000 and 60000.
       
       COLOR_?_DEGREES #number# - these three things are used to
       tell the emulator, what the wheel looks like.
       In degrees how much of the half wheel is covered by the
       corresponding color.
       It is very strongly recomended, that these three
       values add up to 180 degrees, though I don't check it...
       BTW..., COLOR1 is 15, COLOR2 is 13, COLOR3 is 14...

       IMAGER_MODE #number# - number between 0 - 6.
       This determines how the imager is to be emulated to the
       screen.
       At some time there was sort of a discussion going on in some
       newsgroup how the goggles could at all be satisfyingly
       emulated. Well probably can't suit you all, but
       I couldn't think of much more, save to insert some goggles
       to the joystick port... (no, I won't do that!)
       Here is what these 7 modes do:


       # 0 only the 'left' side is displayed, unicolor, therefor
           an overlay picture can be used

       # 1 only the 'right' side is displayed, unicolor, therefor
           an overlay picture can be used

       # 2 red/blue for left and right side, if you have some glasses
           you might be lucky and get a glimps of true 3d :-)

       # 3 only the 'left' side is displayed, in the colors corresponding
           to the wheel colors (overlays must be enabled nonetheless)

       # 4 only the 'right' side is displayed, in the colors corresponding
           to the wheel colors (overlays must be enabled nonetheless)

       # 5 both sides are displayed in colors corresponding
           to the wheel colors (overlays must be enabled nonetheless)
           this most probably looks like a real vectrex seen without
           the helmet on :-)
           
       # 6 left side is displayed on the leftmost side of the screen
           right side is displayed on the rightmost side of the screen
           (scaling must be set manually to fit...)
           Actually I like this setting a lot...

       Strangly these different mode sometime need different values
       for the other above described settings.
       I don't really know why. You just have to keep experimenting
       with the values a bit. Whatever mode suits you most... you
       probably must find the settings on your own.
