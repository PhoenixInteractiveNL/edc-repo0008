v0.229:
ADDED: Load Files. Spud now has a universal file loading routine.
ADDED: Poke Memory. You can now POKE memory to add cheats and also use the SGD .pok files.
ADDED: Speed in % in status window.
ADDED: Current tape loaded now displays in status window (Only in 200% display size.)
FIXED: Trigger NMI. I inadvertantly broke the menuitem (though it still worked via the keyboard.)
FIXED: Manic Miner seemed to have a life of it's own so I made a slight adjustment to the keyboard reading routines.
